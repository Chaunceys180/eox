EOX Streaming Application

-Streaming app that provides steaming from a device into users phone (or viewing device)


## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.io/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view Flutter
online documentation(https://flutter.io/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Pre-requisites

Things you will need to get the app working

- Android Studio V3.4 or newer (or similar editor)
- Phone emulator or real phone with developer mode turned on (Google how to turn on
  developer mode on your phone)

## Installing

1. Install Flutter on your computer using this guide
   (https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows)
2. Clone git repo (https://github.com/connerledbetter1/EOXProject.git)
   into the folder you want the project to be
3. Open Android Studio or your choice of editor
4. Add Flutter and Dart plugins to your Android Studio library
5. Open the project using Android Studio (or your choice of editor)
6. You should get a pop-up asking you to get packages once you navigate to pubspec.yaml file
   If not run "flutter pub get" in your android studio terminal.
7. Run main.dart using your emulator or phone.
8. Once you run the app using your phone, your phone should automatically create a copy
   of the app, and you can access the app straight from your phone without opening
   it through your editor.

After you ran the application successfully, you can login using any valid login and
any password thats longer than 6 character without registering as a database
